# Bootstrap 4 Base Layout

The Bootstrap 4 Base Layout is set up with npm & webpack. It automatically compiles bootstrap & our custom SCSS files.
It also includes some commonly used plugins (e.g. font-awesome, slick-slider).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
# run with your own local domain & report (e.g. project-layout.local:5000)
# add your local domain to etc/hosts (e.g. project-layout.local)
# start with your desired port (e.g. 5000)
npm run dev -- --open --port 5000

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
